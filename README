checktimers/addtimer/vactimers

Check/record what your ddo raid timer cooldowns are.
This is a small C program using a sqlite3 database.
I run it in cygwin on windows.

To compile:
Run "make; make install"

Populate database:
Edit sqlite-template with your toon names.
Run "./dbcreate"

To run:
Run "./checktimers" to see the current timers
Run "./addtimer" to add a timer
Run "./vactimers" to delete old timers
